# Contextual Embeddings with Anthropic

This README provides instructions on how to use Anthropic's Contextual Embeddings on a Windows system. Contextual Embeddings are a powerful tool for understanding and leveraging the context of words in natural language processing tasks.

The base code for this project can be found in the following repository: [Anthropic Cookbook - Contextual Embeddings](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/skills/contextual-embeddings)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your Windows system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    Open your command prompt and clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/apiispanen/testcode.git
    cd testcode
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the contextual embeddings, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Data**

    Ensure your data is in a suitable format for processing. Typically, this will be a text file or a dataset containing the text you want to analyze.

2. **Run the Embedding Script**

    Use the provided script to generate contextual embeddings for your data:

    ```sh
    python generate_embeddings.py --input your_data.txt --output embeddings_output.json
    ```

    Replace `your_data.txt` with the path to your input data file and `embeddings_output.json` with the desired output file name.

3. **Analyze the Embeddings**

    Once the embeddings are generated, you can use them for various NLP tasks such as text classification, clustering, or similarity analysis.

## Examples
